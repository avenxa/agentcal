## Completed

- Product Owner authorized AgentCal reactivation and proactive ADS progression until Human Gate.
- Notion portfolio status changed from Closed to Building / In Progress / On Track.
- Prior Superseded / Closed direction retired from Product Truth.
- Project Instructions refreshed to current ADS.
- SELL Scenario Foundation v1 Design Definition created.
- Existing repository and Vercel project retained; no project infrastructure recreated.

## Execution Truth

- Repository: https://github.com/avenxa/agentcal
- Reactivation baseline before governance sync: `d566e24621fa63000589676dfe429960cc4d5acd`.
- Accepted SELL Feature 01 merge: `eaf0cb7503980e217f8078e6228cd57139be69e4`.
- Production URL: https://agentcal-five.vercel.app/
- Production deployment was verified READY from reactivation baseline `d566e246...`.
- No open PRs were found at reactivation review.
- Preserved Feature 02 branch: `feature/02-tier2-export-share` at `25ffeea2e52b652b1345dc6c5978a328349c9d32`; preserved, unfinished, unaccepted.
- At review time Feature 02 was 4 commits ahead and 20 commits behind the then-current main.

## Scope Now

In scope:
- SELL Scenario identity/lifecycle.
- Progressive essential vs optional SELL inputs.
- Hero Result hierarchy.
- Build / Results responsibilities.
- deterministic recalculation.
- readiness/completeness.
- save/reopen product contract.
- jurisdiction/rule-version provenance.
- mobile-first states and accessibility requirements.

Out of scope:
- BUY.
- MOVE.
- Feature 02 continuation/merge.
- runtime AI guidance.
- CRM / AgentConsult workflow.
- second jurisdiction.
- formula or rounding changes.
- premature persistence/auth implementation.

## Verification State

Verified during reactivation:
- actual repository branch state;
- Feature 02 branch preservation;
- no open PRs;
- Vercel production deployment READY and sourced from the reactivation baseline main commit.

Not re-run in this documentation/definition cycle:
- local lint;
- type-check;
- unit tests;
- Playwright E2E.

Historical test evidence remains history only and must be rerun by Builder when implementation begins.

## Human Gate Status

**Not yet approved for Design.**

The current Definition artifact is ready for Product Owner review.

## ONE NEXT ACTION

**HUMAN GATE: Definition Ready — approve or reject SELL Scenario Foundation v1 Design Definition.**

If approved:
1. produce User Flow / IA;
2. create proportionate Wireframe / Design Truth;
3. stop at **HUMAN GATE: Design Approved**;
4. only after Design Approved proceed to Technical Definition and Builder work.

## Stop / Escalation Conditions

Stop if:
- Product Truth conflicts with accepted SELL calculation behavior;
- scope expands into BUY/MOVE/Feature 02/CRM/runtime AI;
- authoritative formulas, rounding, jurisdiction rules or disclosures would change;
- persistence/auth choice becomes a consequential architecture decision before Design approval;
- a destructive production/data action or release boundary is reached.
